# Building Access

Most building access systems tend to use 125Khz unencrypted HID cards such as a Proxcard II.

These can be cloned trivially to any writable T5577 tag via a professional RFID analysis tool like a Proxmark 3 or even a cheap generic cloner. 

Other buildings often support 13.56Mhz MiFare NFC cards with no encryption. A smartphone can easily clone these to most NFC tags, or a NFC enabled Security Token like a Yubikey Neo.
